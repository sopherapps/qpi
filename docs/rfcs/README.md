# QPI RFCs

Design documents for substantial QPI features. Each RFC is self-contained: it
holds both the system design and its phased implementation plan, so a contributor
(human or coding agent) can execute it without re-deriving the architecture.

## Index

| RFC | Title | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0001](./0001-driver-framework.md) | Driver Framework | Implemented |
| [0002](./0002-dashboard-theming.md) | Dashboard Theming | Implemented |
| [0003](./0003-driver-extensibility.md) | Driver Extensibility | Implemented |
| [0004](./0004-calibration-tuners.md) | Calibration Tuners | Implemented |
| [0005](./0005-calibration-graph-completion.md) | Calibration Graph Completion | Implemented |
| [0006](./0006-calibration-graph-in-the-dashboard.md) | The Calibration Graph in the Dashboard | Draft |
| [0007](./0007-calibration-without-priors.md) | Calibration Without Priors | Implemented (§11.5 open) |
| [0008](./0008-parameter-provenance.md) | Parameter Provenance | Implemented |
| [0009](./0009-parallel-calibration.md) | Parallel Calibration | Implemented (untested on hardware) |

RFCs 0004 and 0005 were written before the graph had run on a chip, and say so where it
matters. RFCs 0007 and 0008 are the opposite case: they exist because of what running it
on one found. 0008 was the piece 0007 deferred; both are now implemented, and each records
where building it corrected what it had claimed. 0007 §11.1 was added after both were
closed, because hardware found it — a gap the RFC's own mechanism was meant to cover.

0009 is the first to change *how* the graph is walked rather than what it contains, and it
opens by fixing a defect in 0006 that writing it surfaced: the dashboard has a `running`
style no walk has ever reached.

## Conventions

- Number sequentially: `000N-short-slug.md`.
- Keep design, plan, and decisions in the one RFC file — no separate ADRs. Record
  design decisions in a "Decisions" section of the RFC itself. Split only if a
  document becomes genuinely unwieldy.
- RFCs are living documents; move status Draft → Accepted → Implemented as the
  feature progresses.
