"""Check the documentation against the repository it documents.

Run through ``make test-docs``. This is the static half — the checks that need
nothing installed beyond the SDKs themselves, so they run first and fail fast:

1. **Every ``make`` target a document names exists.** A `make` line in a runbook is
   a promise; ``make test-e2e-driver-framework`` sat in ``docs/driver/operations.md``
   for a release, existing only in the Makefile's ``.PHONY`` list.
2. **Every repository path a document names exists.** Both halves of
   ``pip install ./qpi-driver[cli]`` and of
   ``-o quantify_device_config=quantify.device.example.json`` were wrong at once — a
   directory with no ``pyproject.toml`` and a file that has never existed.
3. **Every ``qpi-driver`` flag a document names is one the CLI accepts.** The flags
   come from each SDK's own ``--help``, so a removed flag cannot linger in a README,
   and each document is checked against the SDK it belongs to.

The runnable half — the snippets, the error transcripts, the catalog, the installed
example — is the rest of ``make test-docs``.

Three deliberate exclusions:

* ``CHANGELOG.md`` is a record of what *was* true, so it quotes commands and paths
  that no longer work on purpose. Checking it would make writing history impossible.
* A fenced block preceded by ``<!-- docs-check: skip -->`` is left alone. Some
  commands are meant to fail — the ``-o qubit_counr=4`` typo that demonstrates the
  option error is the point of the block it is in.
* ``docs/**`` is mostly symlinks to the READMEs, so the real file is walked and the
  link ignored. A harness that walked both would report every failure twice.
