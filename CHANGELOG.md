## [Unreleased]

### Migration

This release breaks the driver CLI's grammar and the Python and TypeScript SDKs'
APIs (RFC 0003 §11). The project is pre-1.0 and makes no stability promise, so a
name that has stopped earning its keep is deleted rather than aliased — the
obligation that comes with that is to break **once** and to publish the table
rather than let anyone discover the changes by failure.

**Every driver is now launched with one verb.** `--operation` is required and reads
`QPI_OPERATION`; `--device`, when omitted, comes from the operation's own default.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `qpi-driver process --device qblox …` | `qpi-driver start --operation process --device qblox …` |
| `qpi-driver monitor --device bluefors_gen1 …` | `qpi-driver start --operation monitor --device bluefors_gen1 …` |

**A driver no longer names itself.** `--name`/`-n` and `QPI_DRIVER_NAME` are gone
from all three CLIs, and `Name`/`name` from all three SDK configs. Delete the flag
from an existing unit file; there is nothing to replace it with, because the name an
admin typed in the dashboard is now what the driver is called. `SERVICE_NAME`
replaces the installers' `QPU_NAME`, which never named a QPU or a driver — it names
the unit file, its journal identifier and its data directory.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `qpi-driver start … --name cryostat-1` | `qpi-driver start …` — the name comes back from `drivers/connect` |
| `QPI_DRIVER_NAME=cryostat-1` | *(nothing; the dashboard is where the name is set)* |
| `install-systemd.sh` with `QPU_NAME=cryostat-1` | `SERVICE_NAME=cryostat-1` |
| `QpuDriver(name=…)`, `BlueforsGen1Driver(name=…)` | *(removed; read `driver.name` after `run()`)* |
| `qpidriver.Config{Name: …}` (Go) | *(removed; read `DriverName()` after `Run`)* |
| `QpiDriverOptions.name` (TypeScript) | *(removed; read `driver.name` after `run()`)* |
| `OperationSpec.default_name` / `DefaultName` / `defaultName` | *(removed; an operation has no name to default)* |

**Behaviour that changed without a rename**, and is worth checking an existing unit
file against:

| What | Was | Is now |
|------|-----|--------|
| An `-o` key no device reads | Silently ignored | Exits 1, naming the valid keys |
| An `-o` value of the wrong type | Coerced ad hoc, or ignored | Exits 1, naming the option |
| `--ca-fingerprint` omitted (TypeScript) | Connected **without verifying the pinned CA** | Exits 1 |
| `--recv-timeout-ms` (TypeScript) | Accepted and ignored | Removed |
| `--ca-file` (TypeScript) | Accepted and ignored | The CA is written there after it verifies |
| `start --operation process` on Go/TypeScript | `unknown process device "mock"; known devices: ` | Says the SDK ships no process devices, and where to find one |
| A `process` driver's dataset `backend` attribute | The driver's display label, hyphens turned to underscores | The executor's own name (`mock`, `qblox`, …) |
| Registering `kind=mock, language=go` | Accepted, with snippets for a device Go has not got | Exits 400, naming what that SDK does ship |

**Python SDK.** The driver-authoring surface is untouched — `QpiDriver`,
`handle_event()`, `emit()`, `every()`, `Event`, `EventType` and `Executor` keep their
names and signatures. What moved is how a driver is registered and launched:

| Removed | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| `run_driver(...)` | `QpuDriver(...).run()` |
| `qpu.run_process(device=..., ...)` | `qpu.build_from_options(executor=..., ...).run()` |
| `bluefors_gen1.run_monitor(...)` | `bluefors_gen1.build_from_options(...).run()` |
| `builtins.PROCESS_DRIVERS`, `builtins.MONITOR_DRIVERS` | `builtins.devices(operation)` / `builtins.resolve(operation, device)` |
| `builtins.DriverRunner` | `builtins.DeviceBuilder` (returns a driver rather than blocking) |
| `resolve_executor(executor, custom_executors, ...)` | `resolve_executor(executor, ...)` — pass the class or instance itself |
| `QpuDriver(custom_executors={"name": Cls})` | `QpuDriver(executor=Cls)` |
| `QpuDriver.OPERATION`, `BlueforsGen1Driver.OPERATION` | `DeviceSpec.operation` |
| `qpu.execute_job()` | `qpu.job_worker()` |
| A builder taking raw `-o` strings | A builder taking `spec.parse_options(raw)` output |

**TypeScript SDK:**

| Removed | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| `DeviceRunner` | `DeviceBuilder`, taking `(config, options: Options)` |
| `QpiDriverOptions.caFingerprint?` | `QpiDriverOptions.caFingerprint` — required |
| `--recv-timeout-ms` | *(gone; the transport is event-driven)* |

**Go SDK** breaks nothing that was reachable: its device table was unexported inside
`package main`. It gains the importable `devices` and `cli` packages.

### Added

- `repo`: Added `make test-docs`, and a CI job that runs it on every pull request — `docs.yml` only ever ran on a `v*` tag, so nothing checked the documentation before a merge. Five steps, so a failure says which kind of claim broke: **static** (every `make` target, repository path, markdown link and `qpi-driver` flag a document names, the flags read from each SDK's own `--help`), **snippets** (the Python blocks executed against the real SDK, the Go and TypeScript blocks extracted and compiled against this checkout, and the four error transcripts in `docs/driver/operations.md` compared with what the CLI prints), **example** (`examples/custom_device` installed against the local SDK, then asked for via `catalog --json`), **catalog** (`sync-driver-catalog` re-run and diffed against a snapshot, so a stale generated table fails rather than sitting there), and **site** (`mkdocs build --strict`, which catches a dead nav entry or internal link). A block that is meant to fail opts out with `<!-- docs-check: skip -->`; a compiled block opts in with `<!-- docs-check: compile=<name> -->`. `CHANGELOG.md` is exempt: it records commands that no longer work on purpose.
- `qpi-driver/py`: Added the device catalog (RFC 0003 §5) — `Operation`, `OperationSpec`, `DeviceSpec`, `OptionSpec` and `DeviceBuilder` in `qpi_driver.builtins.registry`, with `register()`, `operations()`, `devices()` and `resolve()`. A device now describes itself as data next to its own code, so `--device` accepts it without any change to the CLI.
- `qpi-driver/py`: Added `qpi_driver.builtins.qpu.device_spec()` for describing a `process` device that runs a given executor, including one the SDK does not ship.
- `qpi-driver/py`: `process --help` and `monitor --help` now list every device the operation can run and every `-o` key each one reads, with its type, default, example and whether it is required — generated from the device specs, so a new device appears with no CLI change. A device whose install target is not fully installed is listed as `qblox — unavailable: pip install "qpi-driver[cli,qblox]"`, read from package metadata without importing anything, so `--help` works when a device does not.
- `qpi-driver/py`: Added `qpi-driver devices [--operation OP]`, the same catalog as readable text for every operation at once.
- `qpi-driver/py`: Added `qpi-driver catalog --json`, the whole catalog as JSON for another program to read. The shape is a contract — QPI-UI checks its own catalog against it, and the Go and TypeScript SDKs mirror it — carries a `schema_version`, and is documented in full on `qpi_driver.builtins.catalog.catalog_dict` (RFC 0003 §9).
- `qpi-driver/py`: Added `DeviceSpec.parse_options()`, `OptionSpec.parse`/`OptionSpec.type_name` and `qpi_driver.paths.as_safe_dir()` — an option's value is checked and converted by its own schema, in one place, instead of each builder hand-rolling `int(...)`, boolean-ish string parsing and path validation.
- `qpi-driver/py`: A distribution can now advertise devices through the `qpi_driver.devices` entry-point group (RFC 0003 §6). `pip install mylab-devices` and its devices appear in `--help`, in `catalog --json` and to `--device`, indistinguishable from a built-in, with nothing to change in the SDK. An entry point that will not import or does not resolve to a `DeviceSpec` is logged and skipped, never fatal.
- `qpi-driver/py`: A device can now be named by import path — `--device mylab.devices:PrestoV2`, or `mylab.devices.PrestoV2`, following Pydantic's `ImportString` convention. For `process` it must import to an `Executor` subclass or instance, for `monitor` to a device builder; either accepts a `DeviceSpec`, which is how a custom device gets a declared option schema and a `--help` entry. Having no declared schema, an import-path device's undeclared `-o` options are passed through as strings — its declared ones, `data_dir` included, are still validated, so the safe-path check applies on this route too. A path that will not import exits 1 with one line, with the filesystem path Python volunteers stripped out of it (RFC 0003 §10).
- `qpi-driver/py`: Added `qpu.device_spec(options=...)` for a custom process device that wants to declare its executor's own `-o` options, and `DeviceSpec.accepts_any_option` for one that cannot.
- `qpi-driver/py`: Added `qpi-driver/py/examples/custom_device/` — an `Executor`, a `DeviceSpec`, and the `pyproject.toml` entry-point stanza, with a README covering all three ways to run it.
- `qpi-driver/py`: `JobPayload` and `CircuitPayload` are now exported from `qpi_driver` itself, which is what writing an executor needs.
- `qpi-driver/go`: Added the importable `devices` package — `Operation`, `OperationSpec`, `OptionSpec`, `DeviceSpec`, `DeviceBuilder`, `Options`, `Registry`, `Register`, `Devices`, `Resolve`, `Catalog` — the Go counterpart of the Python SDK's device catalog (RFC 0003 §5, §8). The device table was an unexported `map[string]deviceRunner` in `package main`, so nothing downstream could extend it.
- `qpi-driver/go`: Added the importable `cli` package with `NewRootCmd` and `Execute`. Go has no runtime import by name, so extension is compile-time: a build of your own calls `devices.Register` and then `cli.Execute`, and gets the same `start`/`devices`/`catalog` commands, the same generated help and the same option validation as the shipped binary. `qpi-driver/go/qpi-driver/main.go` is now exactly that — register the built-ins, hand off. The README documents it with an example that is compiled as part of verifying it.
- `qpi-driver/go`: Added `qpi-driver devices [--operation OP]` and `qpi-driver catalog --json`, emitting the same document as the Python SDK — byte-identical for the shared `bluefors_gen1` device, apart from `extra`, which names a Python install target and is empty where a device is compiled in.
- `qpi-driver/go`: The `bluefors_gen1` monitor now describes itself as a `DeviceSpec` beside its own code, with its five `-o` options typed. `qpi-driver/go/cli` and `qpi-driver/go/devices` have tests where `qpi-driver/go/qpi-driver` had none at all.
- `qpi-driver/js`: Added the `qpi-driver/devices` and `qpi-driver/catalog` entry points — `Operation`, `OperationSpec`, `OptionSpec`, `DeviceSpec`, `DeviceBuilder`, `Options`, `registerDevice`, `devices`, `resolve`, `catalog`, `renderCatalog` — also re-exported from the package root (RFC 0003 §5, §8). Registering a device makes the CLI run it, with generated help, a `catalog --json` entry, and `-o` values checked and converted by the device's own schema.
- `qpi-driver/js`: A device can now be named by import path — `--device ./dist/my-device.js#MyExport`. The separator is `#` rather than Python's `:` because `:` is a URL scheme separator in a JavaScript module specifier; a name without `#` is still read as a registered name, so a typo gets the known-devices error rather than an import failure. The export may be a `DeviceSpec` or a builder. A path that will not import exits 1 with one line, with the absolute paths Node volunteers reduced to their last segment (RFC 0003 §10).
- `qpi-driver/js`: Added `qpi-driver devices [--operation OP]` and `qpi-driver catalog --json`, in the same frozen shape as the Python and Go SDKs.
- `qpi-driver/js`: `src/builtins/cli.ts` has a test file, and `src/devices.ts`/`src/catalog.ts` are covered too — 81 tests where the CLI had none.
- `qpi-driver/js`: `--ca-file` is now honoured: the downloaded root CA is written there after it has been verified, as the Python and Go SDKs do. It was parsed and ignored, so the file never appeared.
- `qpi-driver`, `qpi-ui`: Added coverage measurement and gates, where nothing measured coverage before. `make test-py-cli` enforces 96% over the Python framework modules (achieved 99%), `make test-go-driver` enforces 94% over the Go `devices` and `cli` packages (achieved 97.8%), and `npm test` enforces per-file thresholds on the TypeScript catalog, CLI and CA pinning (achieved 92–100%). Each gate was checked by making coverage drop and watching it fail. The hardware executors and the NNG transport are reported but not gated: they need real instruments or a live server, and are covered by `make test-e2e-driver` — `.agents/ROADMAP-0003-driver-extensibility.md` records every exclusion with its reason.
- `qpi-driver/py`: The QPU worker, the result pump, the SDK's receive loop and shutdown, the pinned-CA download, and the job envelope's validation all have unit tests now — the failure paths the e2e suite cannot reach: an executor that will not resolve, a job that raises, a malformed payload, a socket that times out, a fingerprint that does not match.
- `docs`: Added an "Adding a device on a production node" runbook section (`docs/driver/operations.md`) — how an operator discovers what a node can run, the two ways a third-party device gets there, and what each of the four `-o` validation errors looks like, quoted from the CLI rather than paraphrased.
- `docs`: The `-o` option tables in `qpi-driver/py/README.md` are now generated from `catalog --json` by `make sync-driver-catalog`, between `<!-- catalog:begin -->` markers, so they cannot fall behind the code.
- `docs`: Added `make sync-driver-catalog`, which regenerates both the qpi-ui drift fixture and the README option tables from the Python SDK's catalog.
- `qpi-ui`: Added a drift check between this server's driver catalog and the SDKs' (RFC 0003 §9). `qpi-ui/internal/drivers` now tests itself against a checked-in `testdata/catalog.json` generated by `qpi-driver catalog --json`, and fails when the two disagree about which devices exist, which install target ships them, or which `-o` keys each reads — and the other way, when the SDKs know an operation this server has no handler for. Regenerate the fixture with `make sync-driver-catalog`, which every failure message names; doing so is the deliberate act of recording a catalog change.
- `qpi-ui`: `drivers.Option` now carries `Help`, `Required`, `Default` and `InSnippet` alongside `Example`, mirroring the SDKs' option schema. The `process` devices' five `-o` keys are filled in, where `processSpec` previously declared none — they have working defaults, so none of them is pre-filled in a rendered snippet, but the catalog now says they exist. `InSnippet` is what decides that: `bluefors_gen1` pre-fills `channels` and `base_url` and keeps `api_key`, `poll_interval` and `timeout` out of a copy-pasted command.

### Changed

- `qpi-driver`: [BREAKING] The `process` and `monitor` subcommands are replaced by one `start` verb taking `--operation`, in all three SDKs at once (RFC 0003 §4). One verb because everything about launching a driver is the same whichever operation it is — and because a third party can add a device, but only QPI-UI can add an operation, so the operation is an argument rather than part of the grammar.

  | Before | After |
  |--------|-------|
  | `qpi-driver process --device qblox …` | `qpi-driver start --operation process --device qblox …` |
  | `qpi-driver monitor --device bluefors_gen1 …` | `qpi-driver start --operation monitor --device bluefors_gen1 …` |

  `--operation` is required, has no short form (`-o` is `--option`, and `-O` beside it would be a hazard), and reads `QPI_OPERATION`. `--device` and `--name`, when omitted, now come from the operation's own defaults. The dashboard's setup snippets, all three `install-systemd.sh` installers and the e2e harness render the new grammar; the `OPERATION` environment variable the installers take is unchanged.
- `qpi-driver/go`, `qpi-driver/js`: [BREAKING] `start --operation process` now says that the SDK ships no process devices and where to find one, instead of `unknown process device "mock"; known devices: ` with an empty list and a default device that never existed there (RFC 0003 §8).
- `qpi-driver/js`: [BREAKING] **A CA fingerprint is now required, and there is no longer any code path that connects without checking it.** *Certificate pinning* is the industry term for what the check does: a driver downloads the server's root CA over plain HTTP, then refuses it unless the SHA-256 of its DER bytes equals the fingerprint the operator was handed out of band. Pinning one certificate is what makes the download safe — without it, anything that can answer for the server's address can hand the driver a CA of its own and read every job that follows. The SDK skipped the check entirely when `caFingerprint` was absent, so an unpinned connection was reachable by leaving an argument out — the kind of opt-out a copy-pasted command hits by accident (RFC 0003 §10). `QpiDriverOptions.caFingerprint` is now required, and `verifyFingerprint` throws on an empty one rather than returning quietly.
- `qpi-driver/js`: [BREAKING] `DeviceRunner` is now `DeviceBuilder`, and a builder receives `(config, options)` where `options` is an `Options` carrying values already checked and converted against the device's own schema, rather than a `Record<string, string>`. An `-o` key the chosen device does not read is now an error naming the keys it does, where before it was silently ignored.
- `qpi-driver/js`: [BREAKING] `--recv-timeout-ms` is gone. It was parsed and ignored, and it names a polling interval this SDK does not have — the TypeScript transport is event-driven, so there is nothing for it to time out. Accepting it was advertising a knob that did nothing.
- `qpi-driver/py`: [BREAKING] An `-o` key the chosen device does not read is now an error naming the keys it does, where before it was silently ignored. A typo such as `-o data_dirr=/data` used to mean a driver running with a default nobody chose; it now exits 1. Anything that passed an unrecognised `-o` key deliberately, expecting it to reach the executor, must declare it in a `DeviceSpec` (see `qpu.device_spec()`).
- `qpi-driver/py`: [BREAKING] A device builder is now handed options that have already been checked and coerced against its own `DeviceSpec` — `build_from_options(options=spec.parse_options(raw))` — rather than raw strings. Calling a builder directly with `{"job_timeout": "30"}` no longer coerces it, and an omitted key is no longer defaulted by the builder.
- `qpi-driver/py`: [BREAKING] A device builder now returns an *unstarted* driver and the caller starts it, matching the TypeScript SDK (RFC 0003 §7). A driver can therefore be built and asserted on with no server running.

  | Removed | Replacement |
  |---------|-------------|
  | `run_driver(...)` | `QpuDriver(...).run()` |
  | `qpu.run_process(device=..., ...)` | `qpu.build_from_options(executor=..., ...).run()` |
  | `bluefors_gen1.run_monitor(...)` | `bluefors_gen1.build_from_options(...).run()` |
  | `builtins.PROCESS_DRIVERS`, `builtins.MONITOR_DRIVERS` | `builtins.devices(operation)` / `builtins.resolve(operation, device)` |
  | `builtins.DriverRunner` | `builtins.DeviceBuilder` (returns a driver rather than blocking) |
  | `resolve_executor(executor, custom_executors, ...)` | `resolve_executor(executor, ...)` — pass the class or instance itself |
  | `QpuDriver(custom_executors={"name": Cls})` | `QpuDriver(executor=Cls)` |
  | `QpuDriver.OPERATION`, `BlueforsGen1Driver.OPERATION` | `DeviceSpec.operation` |
  | `qpu.execute_job()` | `qpu.job_worker()` |

- `qpi-driver/py`: The driver-authoring surface is unchanged — `QpiDriver`, `handle_event()`, `emit()`, `every()`, `Event`, `EventType` and `Executor` keep their names and signatures. Only how a driver is registered and launched moved.

### Fixed

- `qpi-driver/js`: The SDK set no timeout on any outbound network call, where the Python and Go SDKs both use 10 seconds. A server behind a firewall that drops packets left the driver hanging inside `run()` instead of failing — Node's `fetch` falls back to undici's defaults, which are minutes rather than seconds, and `tls.connect` has none at all beyond the OS TCP timeout, so a TLS handshake that stalls after TCP connect waited indefinitely. Under systemd's `Restart=on-failure` such a unit is never restarted, because it never fails. The `drivers/connect` handshake, the root CA download and both NNG dials now share the same hard-coded 10s deadline as the other two SDKs, and one that expires says what timed out and against which address rather than raising a bare abort. The deadline bounds the dial only: an idle connection afterwards is normal for this event-driven transport, which is why `--recv-timeout-ms` was removed rather than repurposed.
- `qpi-driver/go`: `--help` and `devices` no longer advertise an operation's default device in a build that does not have it, and omitting `--device` in such a build now asks for one, naming what is registered, instead of failing over a device the operator never typed. Which devices a Go binary has is decided when it is compiled.
- `qpi-driver`, `qpi-ui`: [BREAKING] **The driver no longer names itself.** `--name`/`-n`, `QPI_DRIVER_NAME`, the `Name`/`name` config field in all three SDKs and `default_name`/`DefaultName`/`defaultName` on the operation specs are all removed, and `handleDriverConnect` no longer writes a name into the driver record. The token is a driver's whole identity — it is what the record is looked up by and, transitively, what says which QPU the driver belongs to — while `name` is a cosmetic, non-unique display label that an admin types in the dashboard. Nothing looks a driver up by it and no unique index exists, so the only thing a `--name` ever achieved was to overwrite what the admin chose, on every connect, from a unit file nobody re-reads. `POST /api/op/drivers/connect` now returns `name`, so a driver *learns* its label instead of asserting one: read `driver.name` (Python, TypeScript) or `DriverName()` (Go) after connecting. `Name` is gone from `DriverConnectRequest`; an older driver that still sends one is not rejected, the field is simply not read. `Host` and `Version` stay accepted and are flagged as dead on the wire — no SDK has ever sent either.
- `qpi-driver/py`: [BREAKING] A `process` device's datasets record the executor's own name as their `backend` attribute (`mock`, `qblox`, …) rather than the driver's display label. `QpuDriver` used to override the executor's name with its own, which is the only reason a `_sanitize_name` existed: a driver called `lab-1` produced datasets claiming a backend of `lab_1`. `_sanitize_name` is gone with it.
- `qpi-driver`: [BREAKING] `install-systemd.sh` reads `SERVICE_NAME` where it read `QPU_NAME`, in all three SDKs, and the dashboard's systemd snippet renders the new name. It never named a QPU or a driver: it names the unit file, its `SyslogIdentifier` and its data directory. Existing invocations must be updated; there is no alias.
- `qpi-driver/js`: `qpi-driver --help` and `--version` exit 0. `exitOverride()` makes commander throw instead of exiting, so that the command tree can be driven in-process by a test — but that also turned printing help into a rejected promise, which the bin reported as an error and exited 1 for. The Go and Python CLIs exit 0, and a `set -e` script that asks a CLI what it can do before using it died on the answer.
- `qpi-driver/go`: `install-systemd.sh` downloads and unpacks the Go toolchain into `/usr/local/go` when the node has none, instead of exiting with instructions to install it and run the script again. `GO_VERSION` overrides which; an architecture with no prebuilt tarball still exits with the link, and `QPI_SKIP_INSTALL=1` still skips the whole step.
- `qpi-driver/py`: A device installed through the `qpi_driver.devices` entry point is no longer skipped. `qpi_driver.builtins` ran `load_installed_devices()` at its own import time, and it is imported by `qpi_driver/__init__.py` on the way to binding `Executor`, `JobPayload` and `OptionSpec` — so a device written the documented way (`from qpi_driver import Executor`) was loaded against a half-initialised package and skipped with "cannot import name 'Executor' from partially initialized module". The entry-point route, the SDK's whole story for shipping a device, therefore worked for nobody. Discovery now runs at the end of `qpi_driver/__init__.py`, the first moment the package a device imports is complete; importing any `qpi_driver` submodule runs that file first, so no route into the registry skips it. It went unnoticed because the only tests of this route mocked `importlib.metadata.entry_points`; `make test-docs` now installs `examples/custom_device` against the local SDK and asserts the device is in `catalog --json`.
- `qpi-driver/py`: Removed a dead branch in `qpu.job_worker`, which tested whether `data_dir` was already among the executor options — it never could be, being a parameter of that same function.
- `qpi-driver/go`, `qpi-driver/js`: [BREAKING] `install-systemd.sh` no longer offers devices the SDK does not ship. Both installers were copied from the Python one, so both prompted with the Python device list (`mock, qiskit_aer, quantify, qblox, presto, bluefors_gen1`) and defaulted to `OPERATION=process`, `DEVICE=mock`. Pressing return through the prompts wrote and enabled a unit whose `ExecStart` can never succeed — "this build ships no process devices" — and, with `Restart=on-failure`, crash-looped it. Both now prompt with and default to `monitor`/`bluefors_gen1`, the one device each actually has. An `OPERATION=process` passed explicitly is no longer offered anywhere and will still fail; run a QPU from the Python SDK or a device of your own.
- `qpi-driver/js`: `install-systemd.sh` installs Node.js with nvm when the target user has none, instead of exiting with instructions to install it and run the script again — the one thing a one-command installer should not do. It also writes a `PATH` into the unit file that contains that `node`: `qpi-driver` is a script with a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang, and systemd's default `PATH` has no nvm install on it, so a unit written without this started only for operators whose Node happened to be system-wide. `NVM_VERSION` and `NODE_VERSION` override what it installs, and `QPI_SKIP_INSTALL=1` still skips the whole step.
- `qpi-driver/py`: `install-systemd.sh` prompts for `DRIVER_OPTIONS` whatever the operation. It asked only for a `monitor`, on the reasoning that a `process` device's options are all defaulted — but a process device reads `-o` keys too (`job_timeout`, `is_dummy`), and only the data dir and the quantify config paths are the installer's own to fill in. Setting anything else meant editing the unit file afterwards.
- `docs`: The root `README.md` described `qpi-driver` as a Python QPU daemon; it now describes the driver framework it is, with the operation/device split that makes it extensible and a QPU as one device of one operation (RFC 0003 §14). Each SDK README states what it actually ships, since only the Python SDK has a `process` device.
- `docs`: Corrected the driver architecture in both the root and Python READMEs: results are pumped by a *thread* in the main process, not a third "Result Sender Process", and the whole worker arrangement belongs to the `process` operation — a `monitor` has none of it.
- `docs`: Fixed the custom-executor example in `qpi-driver/py/README.md` a second time: it defined only `execute()`, so `Executor`'s other abstract method made it impossible to instantiate. Every Python snippet in the driver documentation is now executed against the real SDK by `make test-docs`, so a third occasion is a failing build.
- `docs`: RFC 0003 is `Implemented`, and RFC 0001 §2 now points at it for the operation/device layer rather than being edited in place.
- `docs`: Rewrote the Python README's extension material to tell the same story the Go and TypeScript READMEs do: one heading, "Adding a device of your own", leading with the device — an executor plus a `device_spec` — and the entry point that ships it. `QpuDriver(executor=…)` is a short note under it rather than the first thing offered, because a reader with three co-equal mechanisms in front of them has to work out which one is theirs. The mechanism is unchanged.
- `docs`: `examples/custom_device` renamed its `ThermometerExecutor` to `QuantumXExecutor` and `probe_count` to `qubit_count`. It is a `process` device — a QPU — and a thermometer is a monitor, so the example named itself after the wrong operation. Its `execute()` also returned a `dict` where `Executor` declares `xr.Dataset`, which is the contract `process_result()` and the driver's own dataset writing depend on; it returns a dataset now. `pyproject.toml` depends on `qpi-driver[cli]` rather than the bare SDK — without the extra there is no `typer` and no `qpi-driver` script, so the README's next command could not run — and resolves it from the sibling source tree, so the test installs this checkout rather than a published wheel.
- `docs`: The three SDK READMEs used "the pinned root CA" and "the catalog" as if both were self-evident. Each now says what it is where it first appears: pinning is refusing any root certificate whose SHA-256 is not the fingerprint the operator was handed out of band, and the catalog is the list of operations, devices and `-o` options a build knows about, with the `DeviceSpec`s as its only source.
- `docs`: `qpi-driver/go/README.md` had an empty "Running a built-in as a systemd service" heading, and `qpi-driver/js/README.md` had its manual instructions commented out and its installer example asking for `--operation monitor --device qblox` — a `process` device that neither SDK ships. Both now document the `monitor` devices they actually have, by installer and by hand.
- `docs`: The "Upgrading?" note in each SDK README promised a migration table at `CHANGELOG.md#migration`, an anchor that moves to whichever release most recently had one. It now names the release boundary it is about and links the change log itself, so it cannot come to describe a release that never broke anything.
- `docs`: `qpi-driver/py/README.md` introduced itself as "The Go SDK".
- `docs`: The root `README.md` told the reader to `pip install ./qpi-driver[cli]`, a directory with no `pyproject.toml` in it, and pointed `-o quantify_device_config` at a `quantify.device.example.json` that has never existed — the file is YAML, and both example configs live under `qpi-driver/py/`.
- `docs`: `docs/driver/operations.md` closed with `make test-e2e-driver-framework`, a target that existed only in the Makefile's `.PHONY` list. Removed the phantom from `.PHONY` and named the real target.
- `qpi-ui`: [BREAKING] Registering a driver whose kind the chosen language's SDK does not ship is now a 400 naming what that SDK does ship. `POST /api/op/drivers/create` accepted any kind×language pairing, and `drivers.Snippets` rendered setup commands for all of them — so `kind=mock, language=go` returned a `--device mock` against a Go binary with no process device at all, a command that exits 1 the first time it is pasted and says nothing about why. The dashboard's language selector now disables the languages a kind is not available in, rather than offering a choice the server rejects. A QPU in Go or TypeScript is a `custom` driver, which is registerable in every language by definition.
- `qpi-ui`: The catalog drift check reads one fixture per SDK (`testdata/catalog.{python,go,typescript}.json`) instead of the Python one alone, and `make sync-driver-catalog` regenerates all three. Which SDK ships which device is a fact only the SDKs know and qpi-ui now records (`drivers.Spec.Languages`) — exactly the kind of copy that rots quietly, and the reason the bug above went unnoticed. `catalog.json` is now `catalog.python.json`.
- `qpi-driver/js`: `catalog --json` no longer exits 1. Every README spells the command that way and the Go and Python CLIs both accept the flag — as a no-op, JSON being the default — but the TypeScript one had only `--text`, so the documented command failed on the one SDK of the three where interchangeability is the point.
- `repo`: `render_catalog_table.py` moved from `qpi-driver/` to a new top-level `scripts/`. It is documentation tooling for this repository — `make sync-driver-catalog` runs it — and sitting at the root of `qpi-driver/` it read as part of a published SDK. `qpi-driver/py/tests/half_imported_device.py` moved to `tests/fixtures/` for the same reason: it is not a test module but an input to one, a module that raises `ImportError` on purpose.
- `qpi-driver/py`: Fixed the custom-executor example in `qpi-driver/py/README.md`, which passed a `custom_executor=` keyword that no function accepted and would have failed with `Unknown executor name 'custom'`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- `qpi-ui`: Added Admin Theme Management feature (RFC 0002) allowing administrators to create, preview, activate, and delete custom themes directly from the dashboard.
- `qpi-ui`: Added `themes` collection to PocketBase database for persisting theme records and custom branding configurations (logo, favicon).
- `qpi-ui`: Added `/api/theme/defaults`, `/api/theme/active`, `/api/theme/css`, and `/api/theme/js` endpoints to serve active theme configuration and injected assets.
- `qpi-ui`: Added `activeTheme` to `AppConfig` to serve as a high-performance, globally consistent in-memory cache for the active theme, avoiding expensive database queries.
- `qpi-ui`: Added React `ThemeContext` on the frontend for dynamic application of CSS variables (`rgb()` variants) and custom assets based on the active theme, gracefully falling back to a compiled-in default theme.
- `qpi-ui`: Added a Theme management UI to the Admin Dashboard (Settings -> Appearance) for customizing Design Tokens (JSON) and raw Custom CSS/JS with real-time preview functionality.
- `qpi-ui`: Optimized `OnThemeUpsert` hook to use a raw database query to efficiently deactivate sibling themes, avoiding nested hook executions.
- `docs`: Added `docs/theming.md` documentation guide for the Dashboard Theming engine.

### Fixed

- `qpi-driver/js` and `qpi-client/js`: Fix failing npm publish in GitHub actions

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- `qpi-ui`: Added the event-based driver framework (RFC 0001) with the `drivers` collection (`name`, `qpu`, `kind`, `language`, `events`, `token`, `status`, NNG ports) for registering and managing external driver processes.
- `qpi-ui`: Added `POST /api/op/drivers/create`, `POST /api/op/drivers/connect`, and `POST /api/op/drivers/toggle` endpoints for driver lifecycle, token issuance, and TLS/NNG port negotiation.
- `qpi-ui`: Added the `events` trace log collection for driver-to-UI events (`source`, `driver`, `qpu`, `type`, `payload`, `ts`) with composite index `idx_events_type_ts` on `events(type, ts)`.
- `qpi-ui`: Added background retention pruning for the `events` log (`events-retention` / `QPI_EVENTS_RETENTION`, default `720h`; `events-prune-interval` / `QPI_EVENTS_PRUNE_INTERVAL`, default `1h`).
- `qpi-ui`: Added per-driver inbound event rate limiting (`event-rate-limit` / `QPI_EVENT_RATE_LIMIT`, default `100`/sec).
- `qpi-ui`: Added the **Drivers** and **Monitoring** dashboard pages for superusers — managing driver records, copying setup snippets, viewing live status, and displaying real-time `CryostatReading` telemetry charts over PocketBase realtime.
- `qpi-ui`: Added `CryostatReading` event type and handler that persists telemetry readings to the `events` collection.
- `qpi-driver`: Added the Python driver SDK (`qpi-driver/py`, `QpiDriver` base class with `handle_event()`, `emit()`, `every()`), typed event envelope (`Event`, `EventType`), and re-expressed QPU execution as `QpuDriver` (`run_driver`).
- `qpi-driver`: Added the TypeScript driver SDK (`qpi-driver/js`, npm `qpi-driver`) with zero runtime dependencies, implementing NNG PULL/PUSH over Node's built-in `tls`.
- `qpi-driver`: Added the Go driver SDK (`qpi-driver/go`, `go get github.com/sopherapps/qpi/qpi-driver/go`) implementing `Base` over `go.nanomsg.org/mangos`.
- `qpi-driver`: Added the official `bluefors_gen1` cryostat monitoring driver across Python (`qpi-driver[cli,bluefors_gen1]`), TypeScript (`qpi-driver/builtins/bluefors-gen1`), and Go (`qpi-driver/go/qpi-driver/bluefors`), polling the Bluefors Remote Access Control API Gen. 1.
- `qpi-driver`: Added unified CLI runners (`process`, `monitor`, `version`) and systemd installer scripts (`install-systemd.sh`) across Python, TypeScript, and Go.
- `docs`: Added RFC 0001 (`docs/rfcs/0001-driver-framework.md`) and the driver framework operations runbook (`docs/driver/operations.md`).

### Changed

- `qpi-ui` & `qpi-driver`: Unified all QPU driver operations on the event-based driver framework (RFC 0001), replacing legacy direct QPU connections with event-driven `QpuDriver` instances.
- `qpi-driver`: [BREAKING] Reorganised the Python SDK repository directory from `qpi-driver/` to `qpi-driver/py/`, matching `qpi-driver/js` and `qpi-driver/go`.
- `qpi-driver`: [BREAKING] Reorganised the driver CLI around operations (`process` for QPUs, `monitor` for telemetry sensors) dispatched by `--device` with repeatable `-o key=value` options instead of the legacy `start --executor` interface.
- `qpi-ui`: Moved driver catalog definitions into a data-driven `internal/drivers` registry keyed by operation.
- `e2e`: Updated verification suite and test runners to connect all drivers via `POST /api/op/drivers/connect` and validate `bluefors_gen1` monitoring events across Python, TypeScript, and Go.
- `qpi-ui`: [BREAKING] The `QPU` struct was stripped of connection-related state that is now managed by the Driver framework. Removed `AccessToken`, `NNGCommandPort`, `NNGResultPort`, `DeviceConfig`, and `DriverVersion` fields, converting it into a pure registry entity.
- `qpi-ui`: [BREAKING] Simplified `handleQPUCreate` as it no longer generates tokens or sets up legacy executor configurations.
- `qpi-ui`: [BREAKING] Stripped removed QPU fields from `QPUCreateResponse`, `QPUUpdateResponse`, etc.
- `e2e`: Updated the backend/driver integration test (`verify.py`) to correctly retrieve authentication tokens using the new `drivers/create` endpoint rather than the removed fields on the QPU response.
- `e2e`: Fixed a local environment flakiness in the cypress script by utilizing `npm install --no-package-lock`.
- `docs`: Change driver docs folder structure to resemble that for clients due to qpi-driver folder restructure.

### Fixed

- `qpi-driver`: [BREAKING] Fixed inconsistent result dictionary shape returned by `build_qiskit_result`: `circuit_results` is now always present as a list of per-circuit experiment dicts regardless of circuit count, and redundant top-level `hex_counts` has been removed in favor of `circuit_results` and top-level `counts`.

### Removed

- `qpi-ui`: [BREAKING] Removed the legacy non-event QPU connection endpoint (`POST /api/op/qpus/connect`) and old dispatcher/listener routines. All drivers now connect through `POST /api/op/drivers/connect`.
- `qpi-driver`: [BREAKING] Removed legacy non-event driver module (`qpi_driver/driver.py`). Drivers now run via `QpuDriver` (`qpi_driver.builtins.qpu`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

- Yanked

## [0.0.42] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- `qpi-driver`: Added `CRZGate` and `CPhaseGate` support to both the qblox and quantify executors' gate conversion.
- `qpi-driver`: Replaced the one-off Toffoli-only unitary test with at a test covering every unitary gate branch in `to_qblox_gates`/`to_quantify_gates`.

### Fixed

- `qpi-driver`: Fixed the misnamed `hex_counts` output of `build_qiskit_result`, which returned binary-string-keyed counts (duplicating `counts`) instead of hex-keyed counts: it now genuinely converts to hex via the existing `counts_to_hex` helper, and the redundant Qiskit `Result` construction (and its `build_experiment_result` helper) used only to derive that value was removed.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed 'can only handle OpenQASM 2.0, but given 3.0' error caused by genuine error in OpenQASM 3
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed meas_level=2 counts collapsing all shots into one bin
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed meas_level=2 counts being keyed by qubit index/width instead of the classical register: a qubit measured into more than one clbit now reports each measurement as an independent bit, `measure q[i] -> c[j]` positions bits by clbit index `j` (little-endian, `c[0]` rightmost) rather than qubit index, and the bitstring width matches `num_clbits` instead of `2 ** n_qubits`.
- `qpi-driver`: Corrected the Toffoli (CCX) decomposition in both qblox and quantify executors.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed the qblox and quantify executors only running the first circuit of a batch: `execute` now runs every circuit in `payload.circuits`, honouring per-circuit `shots` and `parameter_values`, and concatenates the results along a `circuit_index` dimension like the simulator executors.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed multi-circuit batches with heterogeneous classical-bit/qubit widths raising or misaligning in the mock, qiskit-aer, qblox and quantify executors: per-circuit datasets are now bundled independently instead of being force-concatenated onto a shared axis, and the recorded `shots`/`n_qubits` metadata reflects what was actually used per circuit rather than the batch default or only the last circuit.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed fragile `ThresholdedAcquisition` discrimination that relied on the backend returning exactly `1.0`: the discriminator now uses a midpoint threshold (`r >= 0.5`), correctly classifying floating-point values just below `1.0` and averaged fractional bins as `|1>`, consistent with the simulator path.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed the qblox `FluxTunableCoupler` CZ compilation anchoring the virtual-Z phase corrections ambiguously: both `ShiftClockPhase` corrections now reference the square pulse explicitly (`ref_op=pulse`, `ref_pt="start"`) instead of the child correction implicitly chaining off the parent correction, so both are unambiguously applied at the pulse start and match the quantify executor's behaviour.
- `qpi-driver`: Removed a dead condition in the qblox `_apply_parameters`: `callable(attribute) and not hasattr(attribute, "__class__")` was always `False` since every object has `__class__`, so it never contributed to the branch decision; the condition now expresses only the check that actually applies.
- `qpi-driver`: Documented that `PhaseGate` and `RZGate` are intentionally mapped to the same `Rz` operation in both the qblox and quantify executors' gate conversion: they differ only by an unobservable global phase for a standalone gate. No functional change.

## [0.0.41] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

## [0.0.40] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- `qpi-driver`: Fixed 'Frequency settings underconstrained for freqs.clock=0. Neither LO nor IF supplied (freqs.LO=None, freqs.IF=None).'
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed 'ValueError: Operation 'CZ(qC='q1',qT='q2')' contains an unknown clock 'q1_q2.cz''

## [0.0.39] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- `qpi-ui`: Reduced built binary size by compiling with `-ldflags="-s -w"` (stripping symbol table and DWARF debug information).

## [0.0.38] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- `qpi-driver`: Added safe-path validation for `--data-dir` and `--ca-file` to prevent writing to unsafe/unauthorized locations.
- `qpi-driver`: Added environment variable defaults for `QPI_DATA_DIR`, `QPI_CA_FILE`, `QPI_QUANTIFY_DEVICE_CONFIG`, and `QPI_QUANTIFY_HARDWARE_CONFIG` to the systemd service installer.
- `qpi-driver`: Added the FluxTunableCoupler as a CompositeSquareEdge for qblox and quantify executors

### Changed

- `docs`: Updated README files to provide detailed instructions for installing the server via pre-compiled binaries, native Linux packages (`.deb`), and using the non-interactive/interactive systemd installation script for the driver.
- `qpi-driver`: Sanitized driver/device names to replace hyphens (`-`) with underscores (`_`) for executor compatibility.
- `qpi-driver`: Added `--prerelease allow` flag to the `uv tool install` command for the `qblox` executor in `install-systemd.sh`.

### Fixed

- `qpi-driver`: Fixed permissions/directory creation bugs and improved `uv` location detection in `install-systemd.sh`.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed standard Python test output teardown issues by gracefully unregistering the default QCoDeS instrument closing handler from `atexit` and closing them in a test session fixture while logging is still active.
- `qpi-driver`: Ensured the target parent directory for the CA certificate exists before saving the file.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed minor code linting errors.

## [0.0.37] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- `docs`: Enabled mermaid diagram rendering in mkdocs material theme by adding the `pymdownx.superfences` markdown extension in `mkdocs.yml`.

## [0.0.36] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- `qpi-ui/dashboard`: Moved the React dashboard path from `/dashboard/` to the root path `/` to improve user experience.

## [0.0.35] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Fixed a race condition where a driver failing to dial the NNG socket would incorrectly leave the QPU marked as `online`. QPU online status is now strictly determined by the NNG socket attachment lifecycle.
- `qpi-ui`: Fixed an issue where regenerating root CA certificates returned an empty fingerprint, causing authentication failures for new driver connections.

## [0.0.34] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Fixed an issue in the admin dashboard where dismissed system notifications reappeared on page refresh. Dismissals are now correctly persisted via proxy user API requests.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed a `panic: nng is not fork-reentrant safe` error in multiprocessing environments by deferring the NNG TLSConfig initialization until after the worker processes have forked.

## [0.0.33] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- `qpi-ui`: Added `--ip-addr` (or `QPI_IP_ADDR`, or `ipAddr` in config) to explicitly specify the public IP for binding TLS sockets. The provided IP is now properly encoded in the X509 certificate's SAN IP block.

### Changed

- `qpi-driver`: Updated NNG setup logic. The driver now establishes connections using the explicit NNG IP address returned by the server via `ConnectResponse`, decoupling it from the HTTP QPI address.

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Removed the `fetchHostIPs()` autodiscovery logic which caused unintended behavior when deployed behind proxies.
- `qpi-driver`: Fixed a race condition where the result sender process could attempt to read the CA certificate from disk before the main process had downloaded it.

## [0.0.32] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- `qpi`: Fixed various linting errors across the Go and React UI codebases.

## [0.0.31] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- `qpi-ui`: Made the metric cards on the Overview dashboard (Active QPUs, Queue Status, Next Booking) clickable so they quickly route to their respective tabs.
- `qpi-ui`: Clarified the "Load Example" button text and icon in the Jobs Console to read "Load Bell State Example".

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Fixed "authentication required" error that occurred when superusers attempted to submit a quantum job. Superusers are now transparently issued a proxy `users` record with unlimited QPU seconds to satisfy relational constraints.

## [0.0.30] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- `qpi-ui`: Light mode support for the dashboard UI with a theme toggle. Dark mode remains the default.
- `qpi-ui`: Added an admin option to delete QPUs from the QPU Registry, complete with a confirmation modal.
- `qpi-ui`: Added a user profile dropdown menu in the dashboard top bar for quick access to settings and signing out.
- `qpi-ui`: Synchronized auth sessions across tabs and between the `/_/` admin UI and `/dashboard`, automatically signing users in/out when state changes globally.

### Changed

- `qpi-ui`: Restricted the "Create QPU" and "Toggle Status" buttons in the QPU Registry tab to administrators only, while still allowing standard users to view available QPUs.
- `qpi-ui`: Conditionally hide the username and password login fields if `passwordAuth` is disabled in the PocketBase users collection.

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Fixed the QPU Registry cards to properly display the Executor Driver (`executor_type`).

## [0.0.29] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- `ci`: Fixed failing python test step in CI.

## [0.0.28] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- `ci`: Fixed failing lint step in CI by updating `uv sync` flags.

## [0.0.27] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Fixed `CHANGELOG.md` versioning mismatch and correctly restored `0.0.25` entries. Bumping version to `0.0.27` due to tag immutability on `0.0.26`.

## [0.0.26] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Reverted the hiding of the "QPU Registry" dashboard tab for standard non-admin users so that they can see existing QPUs (but cannot register or toggle them).

## [0.0.25] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- `qpi-driver`: Added `install-systemd.sh` script to automate installation of the driver as a systemd background service.
- `qpi-ui`: Added an admin-only endpoint `GET /api/op/version` to retrieve the server's version.
- `qpi-ui`: Added a dynamic version label to the dashboard sidebar (visible only to admins).
- `qpi-ui`: Updated the QPU Registration success modal to generate and display a copyable `install-systemd.sh` execution snippet.
- `ci`: Added a dedicated E2E testing job (`test-systemd-installer`) in GitHub Actions to validate the systemd installation script via a Docker container.

### Changed

- Global: Renamed all instances of "Orchestrator" to "Server" (and "orchestrator" to "server") across documentation, code, and CI scripts.
- Global: Renamed all instances of "Hardware Driver" to "QPU Driver" (and "hardware driver" to "QPU driver") across the project.
- `qpi-ui`: Simplified the `README.md` introduction with a shorter description, a simpler mermaid diagram, and pulled the Quick Start section to the top.

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Fixed a bug in the dashboard (`App.tsx` and `Sidebar.tsx`) where the "QPU Registry" tab was still visible to standard non-admin users.
- `qpi-ui`: Fixed a double-hashing bug in `handleQPUCreate` that caused driver connection snippet tests to fail with `401 Unauthorized`.

## [0.0.24] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Updated the CHANGELOG appropriately.

## [0.0.23] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Used GoReleaser NFPM overrides to separate Debian/RPM and Alpine `init` script configurations, preventing `dpkg` installation crashes (`Default-Start contains no runlevels`) and eliminating improper `systemd` dependencies in `.apk` packages.


## [0.0.22] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- `qpi-ui`: Added `draft: true` to all intermediate `softprops/action-gh-release` asset upload steps to prevent them from prematurely publishing the GitHub release and triggering immutable release errors on subsequent jobs.

  - Added support for OpenQASM `Delay` instructions by mapping them to `IdlePulse`.
  - Added concurrent anchoring (`ref_pt="start"`) for parallel multi-qubit Qiskit instructions (e.g., `Measure`, `Delay`, `Barrier`).
  - Handled invalid `-1` hardware acquisition dummy data thresholds during Qblox and Quantify dummy measurements.
- `qpi`: Resolved Apple Silicon macOS codesign binary integrity crashes during the E2E suite due to dynamically installed `q1asm_macos`.

- `qpi-ui`: Added `*FromRecord` helper mapping functions in the `schema` package to safely construct database model structs from PocketBase `*core.Record` objects.
- `qpi-ui`: Added `qpi_addr` dynamically computed field to the `/api/op/qpus/create` JSON response.
- `qpi-ui/internal/dashboard`: Updated the QPU registry tab to show a success modal upon QPU registration, including copy-to-clipboard icons for both the raw access token and a copyable `qpi-driver` start command.
- `qpi-driver`: Added support for the Qblox Scheduler (`qblox-scheduler`) package via a new `QbloxExecutor` (`qblox`).
- `qpi-driver`: Added `qblox` optional-dependencies group to `pyproject.toml` and a compatibility layer at `qpi_driver/compat/qblox.py` to gracefully handle cases where `qblox-scheduler` is not installed.
- `qpi-driver`: Created automated test suite at `qpi_driver/tests/test_qblox.py` and integrated `test-py-qblox` test target into `GitHub CI` matrix.
- `qpi-client/go`: Added `QpiAddr` field to the `QpuRecord` struct.
- `qpi-ui`: Added `FindAndDeleteOne` and `FindOneByFilter` helpers to the database query layer (`internal/db/queries.go`) to support cleaner repository queries.
- `qpi-ui`: Added validation-tagged API DTO models (`QPUCreateRequest`, `QPUCreateResponse`, `QPUToggleResponse`, `DispatchPayload`, `JobResultUpdate`) under `internal/api/schema.go`.

### Changed

- `qpi-ui`: Integrated the centralized `schema` structs into all custom REST controllers and handlers inside the `api` package, replacing duplicate local private struct definitions.
- `qpi-driver`: [Breaking] Removed deprecated `-H`/`--host` and `-P`/`--port` options from CLI and `run_driver` in favor of `--qpi-addr` / `-a` (env: `QPI_ADDR`, default: `http://127.0.0.1:8090`).
- `qpi-client`: Updated Go/Python/JS client E2E test suites to use the `QPI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `qpi-ui`: Refactored all HTTP REST handlers (`handleNotificationDismiss`, `handleTokenDelete`, `handleQPUConnect`, `handleQPUToggle`) to use database models and generic queries instead of raw `core.Record` objects.
- `qpi-ui`: Removed reflection from `internal/db/queries.go` by refactoring methods to accept a pre-allocated model destination interface, improving performance.
- `qpi-ui`: Separated access token lookup and status validation in `handleQPUConnect` to correctly return `401 Unauthorized` for invalid tokens and `403 Forbidden` for disabled QPUs.
- `qpi-ui/internal/dashboard`: Updated `App.tsx` quantum job submission callback to extract `id` instead of `job_id` from the backend response.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `qpi-ui`: Added `notifications` collection with admin-only CRUD, user visibility rules, broadcast/targeted targeting, time-window filtering, and per-user dismiss support via `POST /api/notifications/{id}/dismiss`.
- `e2e/verify.py`: Added the `test_notifications_crud` E2E test to verify broadcast/targeted visibility, time-window filtering, per-user dismiss, and admin-only CUD enforcement.
- `qpi-ui`: Added `enabled` boolean field to `qpus` collection to allow administrators to toggle QPU drivers on and off.
- `qpi-ui`: Added an update event hook on the `qpus` collection that cancels/stops dispatcher and listener goroutines (and sets status to `"offline"`) when `enabled` is set to `false`, and starts goroutines (and sets status to `"online"`) when `enabled` is set to `true`.
- `qpi-ui`: Enforced `enabled` check in the `/api/op/qpu/register` route to reject registration of disabled QPUs with a `403 Forbidden` response.
- `e2e/verify.py`: Added the `test_qpu_toggle_switch` E2E test to verify the QPU disabled/enabled lifecycle, goroutine lifecycle, and registration blocking.

- `qpi-ui`: Added authenticated CRUD rules and validation hooks for the `qpu_time_requests` collection, supporting user requests, admin approvals/rejections, automatic QPU seconds crediting, and handled request immutability.
- `qpi-ui`: Added authenticated CRUD rules and validation hooks for `time_slots` collection, implementing interval order, overlap checks, auto-population of owner, past booking/update/delete restrictions, and admin bypass capability.
- `qpi-ui`: Added admin-only `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}` endpoint for superusers to update `qpu_seconds` and `api_tokens` on any user record.
- `qpi-client/py`: `QPIBackend.run()` now supports `parameter_values` kwarg for parameterized circuit execution, automatically binding parameters and forwarding ordered values to the API payload.
- `qpi-driver/tests`: Added `@pytest.mark.skipif` decorators to CLI and quantify tests so they gracefully skip when optional dependencies (`typer`, `quantify_scheduler`, `qblox_instruments`) are not installed.
- `Makefile`: Added granular `test-py-base`, `test-py-cli`, `test-py-aer`, and `test-py-quantify` targets for testing each `pyproject.toml` extra in isolation.
- `qpi-driver`: Added an abstract `process_result()` method to the `Executor` interface, letting executors handle their own data processing (e.g. state discrimination, IQ memory formatting) directly in the worker process.
- `qpi-driver`: Implemented state discrimination, average/single IQ memory formatting, and raw trace handling in `MockExecutor`, `QiskitAerExecutor`, and `QuantifyExecutor`.
- `qpi-driver`: Support for `ThresholdedAcquisition` protocol in `QuantifyExecutor` when threshold/rotation parameters are defined on device elements, automatically falling back to software discrimination via `SSBIntegrationComplex`.

### Changed

- `qpi-ui`: Default `qpu_seconds` for new users changed from `1000` to `0`. Users must now be granted QPU time explicitly by an admin via the `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}` endpoint. The `OnRecordCreate` hook that previously set the default has been removed.
- `qpi-driver`: Renamed the `translator` process to `result sender` and simplified it to forward processed dicts via NNG PUSH directly from a queue, eliminating intermediate `.pkl` filesystem serialization overhead.
