// Package drivers is QPI-UI's catalog of registerable driver backends: which
// kinds exist, how each is installed and launched, and which events it takes
// part in (RFC 0001 §3, §7).
//
// A backend is described by a data-only Spec, and the whole catalog is a
// Registry of Specs. Adding a new backend — a new executor or a new monitor —
// means registering one Spec in catalog.go; no other server code changes. A
// backend's operation (the CLI subcommand — `qpi-driver process --device
// <kind>` or `qpi-driver monitor --device <kind>`) and its options are just
// Spec fields, so a differently-shaped backend is more data rather than a new
// branch.
