// Package qpidriver is the Go SDK for building QPI drivers (RFC 0001 §4).
//
// A driver is an external process that exchanges typed events with QPI-UI: it
// handles the events QPI-UI sends it and emits events of its own. Embed
// [Base] in a struct, implement [Handler.HandleEvent] to act on each inbound
// event (switching on its type), and call [Base.Emit] to send an event upward.
// [Base.Every] runs a callback on a timer, for drivers that report on their
// own schedule rather than in reply to a dispatch. [Run] performs the
// handshake, opens the transport, and blocks until the process is signalled to
// stop.
//
// It mirrors the Python SDK (qpi-driver/py/qpi_driver) and the TypeScript SDK
// (qpi-driver/js): the same envelope, the same drivers/connect handshake, and
// TLS with the pinned root CA.
