"""A whole calibration, end to end, against the simulator (RFC 0004 §7).

The other tests take a calibration apart. `test_calibration_dag.py` walks the
graph with stub routines, `test_tuner_routines.py` builds schedules against a
dummy cluster, `test_physics_simulation.py` checks each fit against physics —
and every one of them replaces the pieces on either side of the one it is
testing.

These put it back together. `_execute_calibration` is the calibrate worker's
entry point, so a job dict handed to it here goes through exactly what it goes
through in the driver's subprocess: the tuner, the DAG walk, every routine's
build/run/fit/apply, the write-back to the device YAML, and the report that
comes out the other end. What that covers is the joins — the drift check's
follow-up job being a job the worker can actually run, a fitted frequency
reaching the file the `process` driver reads — which is where the faults a unit
test cannot see actually live.

Needs the `sim` extra and no scheduler extra:

    mean something and it pins the test to how the simulator happens to be tuned, so
    retuning the model breaks a test about the driver.

    So assert against the error the simulator was *given*, as
    `test_rb_recovers_a_known_gate_error` does one tier down: a calibration good enough to
    benchmark recovers the injected error, and one that left a gate miscalibrated reports
    worse than it. Both hold at any injected level, so neither depends on the tuning.

    The 20% is the accuracy of the fit, and it widened from 15% when `fit_rb_decay` pinned
    its asymptote at ``1/2^n``. That is a real trade and worth naming: with the asymptote
    free the fit was more accurate *here* and unusable on hardware, where the amplitude and
    the rate are inseparable and every bound produced a different answer — the 2026-08-16 B
    chip reported 3.6e-05 per Clifford against a physical 2.2e-03. Pinning costs a few per
