"""Every Python snippet in the driver documentation, run against the real SDK.

The claim a code block makes is that it works, and it is the claim most easily
broken: the custom-executor example in ``qpi-driver/py/README.md`` was wrong twice —
once passing a keyword no function accepted, once defining only one of ``Executor``'s
two abstract methods, so it could not be instantiated. Both would have been a line of
output here.

How a snippet is run:

* It is executed in a fresh namespace, so one block cannot lean on another's imports.
* ``QpiDriver.run`` is stubbed. Every driver snippet ends in ``.run()``, which would
  otherwise try to reach a server; what is being checked is that the code up to that
  point is valid and the driver can be constructed at all.
* A block that is deliberately not meant to run is skipped, by preceding it with
  ``<!-- docs-check: skip -->`` in the document. There are none today; the marker
  exists so that a block which needs one does not become a reason to delete this
  test.

Only the documents that describe this SDK: the Python README and the custom-device
example. A ``typescript`` or ``go`` block is somebody else's compiler's business
(``make test-docs``).
