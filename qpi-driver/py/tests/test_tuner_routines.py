"""Every routine compiles against a real scheduler (RFC 0004 §7, tier 2).

These need a scheduler, so they skip on a base install and run under
``make test-py-driver EXECUTOR=quantify`` and ``make test-py-driver EXECUTOR=qblox``. What they prove is that
each routine builds a schedule the backend's compiler accepts — the dummy
cluster returns no real data, so analysis is tier 1's job, not this file's.

The one thing asserted about data here is the opposite of a fit: that a dummy
acquisition makes a routine *fail*, loudly, rather than fit zeros and write them
to the device.
