"""Test doubles built on the transmon simulator (RFC 0004 §7, tier 3).

The simulator itself now lives in `qpi_driver.simulation`, because a thing you
can put where the hardware goes belongs in the package rather than beside the
tests. What stays here is the scaffolding only tests need:

- :class:`StubBackend` records what a routine composes and refuses to run it,
  for a test that supplies the acquisition itself.
- :class:`SimulatedBackend` answers ``run`` by asking the simulator for the
  experiment the schedule encodes — enough to drive a routine through
  ``build_schedule → run → analyse → apply`` with no scheduler installed.
- :class:`SimulatedTuner` puts that behind the real :class:`Tuner`.
- :class:`FakeDevice` stands in for a `QuantumDevice` where a real one would
  need quantify. It serialises, but what it writes names *this* module's class,
  so the file it produces is not one the executor can load — for that, see
  `tests/test_calibration_loop.py`, which uses a real device throughout.
