"""Routines against simulated physics (RFC 0004 §7, tier 3).

Tier 1 fits data generated from the fit's own analytic form — a decaying cosine
in, a decaying cosine fitted — which proves the optimiser converges but not that
the model is the right one. Tier 2 proves a schedule compiles, and the dummy
cluster returns no data at all.

These close the gap. The acquisition comes from diagonalising a real transmon
Hamiltonian (`scqubits`) and integrating the Lindblad master equation (`qutip`),
then the routine has to recover the parameter the simulator was built with.
That makes them the first tests where a routine can be wrong in a way the other
tiers cannot see: a schedule that does not produce the physics its fit assumes
still compiles, and still fits its own synthetic data.

Needs the `sim` extra and nothing else — no scheduler extra. The
routines, the fits and the DAG are numpy and scipy; the schedulers are needed to
*run* a schedule, and here the simulator supplies the acquisition instead. That
is why `make test-py-sim` syncs `--extra sim` alone:
