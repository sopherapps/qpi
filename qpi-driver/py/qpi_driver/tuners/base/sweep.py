"""What one target's schedule swept, carried to its analysis (RFC 0009 §6.6).

A routine used to keep its setpoints on itself — ``self._frequencies`` written in
`build_schedule` and read back in `analyse`. That was correct while a routine ran one
target at a time, and silently wrong the moment it ran several: a sweep centred on a
per-qubit value has a different grid per target, so every fit in a fused group would
have used whichever target built last. Not an error — a plausible curve fitted against
the wrong axis, which is the failure this graph is most scarred by.

So the setpoints belong to the target, and the target's `Sweep` is threaded from the
build to the fit. Keyed by axis name rather than held as attributes because that is how
`escalating` reaches them: a guard refuses an axis by name, and the retry has to widen
that axis and no other.
