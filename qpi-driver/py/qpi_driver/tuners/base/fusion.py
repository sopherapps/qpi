"""One schedule over several targets, and the dataset it returns (RFC 0009 §6).

A Qblox cluster is one arm-and-start resource, so parallelism is not several
schedules submitted at once — the scheduler's own ``start`` disarms every sequencer
in the cluster before arming its own, and two submissions would have no shared time
origin anyway. Simultaneity has to be expressed *inside* one schedule, and that is
what :func:`add_together` is for.

The dataset comes back with one variable per acquisition channel, and
:func:`channel_of` slices it so each routine's `analyse` sees the single-variable
shape it already reads. No fit learns that it ran in company.
