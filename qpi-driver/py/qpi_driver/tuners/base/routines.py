"""One node in the calibration DAG (RFC 0004 §6.4).

A routine is three steps over one target: build a schedule, fit the acquired
data, write the fitted parameters back to the device. It declares what it
depends on, which is what the DAG orders it by, and whether it targets qubits
or edges.

Routines are backend-agnostic — they compose operations from the

the same routine runs under quantify-scheduler and qblox-scheduler alike.

SCALAR_AXES = frozenset({"span"})

#: the same sweep, not by sweeping further.
#:
#: Separate from `SCALAR_AXES` because that one moves ``points`` alongside ``span`` to hold
#: the step size, and a circuit count has no step to hold. Scatter falls as ``1/sqrt(N)``,
#: so the factor a refusal asks for is applied to the count directly.
AVERAGING_AXES = frozenset({"circuits_per_depth"})

#: The most circuits per depth escalation will ask an RB sweep for.
#:
#: RB is the most expensive node in the graph and the cost is linear here, so this is a
#: ceiling on the ceiling: 50 against the shipped default of 10 is five times the runtime
#: of a node that already takes half a minute, and past it the honest answer is that the
#: chip's readout is too noisy to benchmark rather than that the sweep was too small.

#: Measured rather than estimated, after the first version of this got it wrong. A
#: `resonator_punchout` of 846 acquisitions compiled to **12700** Q1ASM instructions on a
#: QRM-RF — 15.0 per acquisition, against a ceiling of 12288. The rule of thumb of "roughly
#: 950 acquisitions" assumed one instruction group per point, and a frequency sweep is
#: three: `Reset`, `SetClockFrequency`, `Measure`. So 900 points is 13511 instructions and
#: over the limit, which is what this constant exists to prevent.
#:
#: 700 leaves 14% headroom at that measured rate. quantify warns rather than raising when a
#: program is too long, and the sequencer may accept it — but a program past the documented
#: maximum risks being truncated, and a truncated sweep loses its *last* setpoints, which is
#: to say the far end of the range escalation just widened to reach. Silently getting the

        are of *pulse* parameters at setpoints known before the run, and a schedule can
        hold those. Two nodes are not, for two unrelated reasons.

        A coupler's parking bias is not a pulse. It is a DC current held for as long
        as the fridge is cold, delivered out of band over qcodes — through an SPI rack
        or a cluster output, but either way not by the sequencer. So a routine that
        sweeps it has to set instrument state, run a schedule, read it, and repeat,
        which is a loop no single schedule contains.

        `qubit_spectroscopy`'s setpoints are not all known in advance. When no line
        turns up near the configured f01 it widens the search, and where the sweep after
        that looks depends on what the wide one found — which a single schedule cannot
        express either, since its setpoints are compiled before any acquisition runs.

        Overriding this takes that loop into the routine rather than giving every node
        a second sweep axis it does not need — which is what RFC 0005 §11 argues for,
        against the reference pipelines' `external_samplespace`. The DAG calls this
        instead of the standard path, and *bias* is whatever can park a coupler, or
        ``None`` when nothing can.

        *timeout_s* is the walk's ``routine_timeout_s``, and an override has to hand
        it to every `backend.run` it makes. It cannot be read from *config*, which is
        this routine's own `RoutineConfig` and knows nothing of the walk — so a loop
        that drops it silently bounds each of its acquisitions by the default instead

    Two ways a Lorentzian fit reports a confident centre for a line that was never

    frequency, so both have to be refused rather than reported.

    **Too narrow for the sweep.** A line narrower than the spacing between setpoints
    did not appear in the data; whatever the fit converged on came from noise between
    the points. Seen in practice: narrowing the line to 63 kHz while the sweep still
    stepped 5 MHz made the routine report a frequency 377 MHz from the qubit, with a
    tidy fit and no complaint.

    **Too shallow to believe.** The opposite shape, and the one the width test cannot
    catch: a *broad* fit through flat data. Measured on a chip whose readout had gone
    off resonance, `qubit_spectroscopy` returned a 1.53 MHz line — clearing the width
    test by a factor of eleven — 5 MHz from the two runs either side of it, from data
    flat to 0.7%. It wrote that to f01, which put `ramsey_12`'s detuning 1.5 MHz out and
    cost the run.

    Judged on the fitted curve's own travel rather than on ``snr``; see
    :data:`MIN_LINE_REACH` for why, and for the 1800 noise fits that decided it. The two
    tests are complementary and both are needed: the width test catches a fit that
    latched onto one bin, which reach cannot, because such a fit has a large span and
    tiny residuals. Reach catches the broad shallow fit, which the width test cannot.

    *axis* names the config key a caller may change and try again with, which turns both
    refusals into an `OutOfRange` carrying the direction each one wants. They want opposite
    things — a flat window wants more spectrum, a line thinner than the grid wants more
    grid — so the direction has to travel with the refusal rather than be inferred from it.
    Left ``None`` both stay a plain `RoutineError`, which is what a caller with no sweep to
    change should see.

    **Too wide for the sweep.** The third shape, and the only one reported rather than
    refused: a Lorentzian broader than the window it was fitted in. The centre may still be
    right — a power-broadened line is a real line, and `ramsey` refines f01 afterwards
    regardless — but its *width* was never in the data, so the linewidth and everything
    derived from it are extrapolation. The 2026-08-16 B chip fitted 107 MHz across a 20 MHz
    sweep, and reported a quality factor and an SNR of 163 off the back of it.

    Returns:
        1.0 when the line is wider than the sweep, 0.0 otherwise — a quality flag for the
        caller to publish beside its numbers, never a reason to withhold them.

    Raises:
        RoutineError: naming the number that failed and what to change, since a

    """*config* with the axis *refusal* named stretched by its factor.

    The setpoints come from what the routine actually built rather than from the config,
    because the default case is the one that matters: a config with no ``delays`` in it is
    exactly the config whose sweep needs widening, and reading only the config would find
    nothing to stretch. A routine records its setpoints under the axis's own name on the
    target's `Sweep`, which is what makes them readable from here.

    That name is load-bearing and was not being checked. Four routines stored their
    setpoints under a name of their own — `drag` as ``_betas`` against an axis of
    ``motzois``, and three more — so this found nothing, returned *config* unchanged, and
    `escalating` re-raised. The refusal named the range it had already swept, which reads
    exactly like a chip that has no answer in it: in an August 2026 bring-up `drag` failed
    with an optimum of -0.614 against a swept +/-0.2 and never widened once.
    `test_every_swept_axis_is_readable_from_outside` now holds the convention.

    Only the setpoints move. Everything else the operator set is carried through, because
    a wider sweep is still their sweep — and the axis is stored under its own config key,
    so the next attempt reads it exactly as though it had been asked for.

    A **scalar** axis is widened rather than the setpoints it would produce, and that
    distinction is what makes this usable on a frequency sweep. Stretching a list of
    frequencies gets three things wrong at once: it anchors at the low end and reaches
    only upward, so it widens away from a resonator that sits below the window; it holds
    the point count, so a wider span steps over a narrow line; and it lands in the config
    as an explicit ``frequencies``, which `_frequency_sweep` passes through *unclamped*,
    so the next attempt asks the NCO for a frequency it cannot reach. Widening ``span``
    instead leaves centring, resolution and the band clamp where they already live.
