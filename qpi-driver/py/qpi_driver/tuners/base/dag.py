    A node whose input was never measured cannot measure anything either. Running it

    failed, and six nodes behind it measured a qubit still in ``|0>`` and reported
    confident numbers fitted from its noise.

    Keyed on *parameters* rather than on routines, which is what makes it correct here.
    `depends_on` orders the walk and is not a data dependency — `cz_chevron` depends on
    `rb` and `flux_spectroscopy`, and neither writes a parameter at all — so blocking a
    node because a neighbour failed would decline work that has everything it needs.
    Two consequences fall out of the parameter view for free:

    - **A failed refiner blocks nothing.** Seven parameters have two writers, the
      first producing and the second refining. `ramsey` failing leaves the
      `clock_freqs.f01` that `qubit_spectroscopy` produced, so every node reading f01
      still runs.
    - **A disabled node is not a failed one.** It never ran, so it never recorded a
      failure, and nothing downstream is blocked by its absence. A parameter an
      operator supplies by hand — `measure.integration_time` and `r12.ef_duration` have
      no producer in the graph at all — is likewise never in question.
