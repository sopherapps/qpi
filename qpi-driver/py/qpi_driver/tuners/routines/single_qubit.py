#: puts the ceiling at 2/3 of the sweep, leaving the decay visibly flattened before the

#: How far AllXY's ``|0>`` and ``|1>`` reference plateaus must stand apart, in units of the

#:
#: The contrast between those two groups is AllXY's own normalisation denominator, so when
#: it is noise the normalisation divides by noise and manufactures a full-scale response
#: out of nothing. On the August 2026 B chip, whose qubit was never excited, that produced
#: a "normalised response" ranging -22 to +12.5 and an rms deviation of 9.65 — reported as
#: success. `allxy_check` turned the same data into a *fidelity* of 0.533 and offered it to
#: the drift check, which is the number a threshold would have believed.
#:
#: Three sigma because the plateaus average five and four points: two random groups of that
#: size differ by about 0.7 of their own scatter, so three separates noise from any real
#: contrast without demanding a good gate — a badly calibrated one still has full readout
#: contrast between ``|0>`` and ``|1>``, which is exactly what AllXY then measures the shape

    Two reasons, and the first is a correctness bug. Min-max normalisation assumes the
    smallest reading is ``|0>`` and the largest is ``|1>``, which is only true when the
    readout happens to make ``|z|`` rise with excitation. Whether it rises or falls depends
    on which side of the resonator's line the readout sits, and `resonator_spectroscopy`
    puts it on the ground-state resonance — where ``|1>`` reflects *less*. Inverted, this
    compared a descending response against an ascending staircase and reported an rms
    deviation of 0.65 on a well-calibrated qubit. The five ``|0>`` pairs and four ``|1>``
    pairs are in the sequence precisely so it can normalise itself, and dividing by their
    difference carries the sign.

        the operator.
