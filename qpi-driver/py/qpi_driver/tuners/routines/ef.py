"""The 1-2 transition: driving the transmon's third level (RFC 0005 §7).

A transmon is not a qubit, it is an anharmonic ladder that is *used* as one, and the
third rung is the difference. Every gate leaks a little population into ``|2>``,
where two-state readout reports it as one of the other two — so a leaked shot is not
merely lost, it is counted as an answer. Measuring that is what the EF chain is for,
and it is the only route to it.

`f12_spectroscopy` found where the transition is. These drive it.

Every routine here plays a raw pulse rather than a gate, because neither scheduler's
transmon has an EF gate: the device config's operations are built for ``rxy`` on the
``.01`` clock, and the ``.12`` clock has no gate that references it. The pulse is
therefore assembled here, and its parameters live in `EFDrive` on a
`CalibratedTransmon` — an element without one gets no EF calibration, which is the
same opt-in every other addition in this RFC makes.

#: How far the fitted 1-2 pi amplitude may sit from the ladder the 0-1 one implies.
#:
#: A transmon's 1-2 matrix element is sqrt(2) times its 0-1 one, so at the same duration the
#: same rotation needs ``amp180 / sqrt(2)``. That is a statement about the ladder rather than
#: about a chip, which is what makes it usable as a bound: it holds to about 10% where it has
#: been measured — 0.1577 fitted against 0.1429 predicted — and a factor of two either way
#: leaves room for the duration differing and for the approximation itself.
#:
#: The failure it exists for, on the August 2026 B chip: `rabi_12` fitted ``ef_amp180`` of
#: 0.0677 against an ``amp180`` of 0.5757, which the ladder puts at 0.4071 — six times out,
#: so the pulse it wrote turned a fraction of a rotation rather than half of one. Nothing
#: objected, and the whole EF chain then measured a qubit still in |1>: the second-excited
#: sweep reported |2> *closer* to |0> than |1> is, which no transmon does, and
#: `three_state_discrimination` was left as the only node that refused.
MAX_EF_LADDER_ERROR = 2.0

#: How much of an oscillation the sweep must show before the ladder stops being evidence.
#:
#: The bound above exists for one failure and only one: `fit_rabi` fitting a *partial*
#: rotation, where a drive too weak to turn a pi leaves the cosine's half period longer
#: than the sweep and the fit extrapolates an arc into a smaller amplitude. That failure
#: has a signature, and it is the opposite of what an off-ladder amplitude looks like when
#: the drive is strong: a partial rotation shows *less* than one period, never more.
#:
#: The August 2026 B chip is why this is here. Its `rabi_12` sweep runs 0 to 0.5 and holds
#: three and a half full periods — five maxima and five minima, evenly spaced, a flat
#: envelope, a residual of 7.8% of contrast, and a peak-to-peak 1.5x `rabi`'s own, which is
#: what |0>-|2> should give against |0>-|1>. Nothing about that is a partial rotation, and
#: the ladder refused it three runs running on an amplitude 3.7x off. Both drives share a
#: LO, mixer corrections and attenuation in that chip's hardware config, so the factor is
#: real and unexplained — but a resolved measurement is not the place to litigate it.
MIN_RESOLVED_PERIODS = 1.0

#: The fraction of `rabi`'s contrast a 1-2 sweep must swing to count as turning a pi.
#:
#: `rabi_12` maps ``|2>`` back through a 0-1 pi before reading, so its two extremes are
#: ``|0>`` and ``|2>`` — a wider dispersive separation than the ``|0>``-``|1>`` one `rabi`
#: measures, which is why chips come in *above* 1.0 rather than at it. A drive too weak to
#: turn a pi cannot reach here at all: it moves a fraction of the population by definition,
#: and the fraction is what the fitted amplitude is short by.
#:
#: So this separates the two failures the ladder ratio alone cannot, and it does so without
#: a number taken from any chip: it is a ratio of two contrasts measured on the same qubit
#: through the same readout, minutes apart. 0.7 leaves room for the ``|2>`` shift being
#: sub-linear and for readout drift between the two nodes, and still sits far above the
#: fraction a partial rotation can produce.
MIN_LADDER_SWING = 0.7

#: The ratio a transmon's two lowest transitions must show, at the same pulse.
#:
#: The 1-2 matrix element is ``sqrt(2)`` times the 0-1 one, so the *same* pulse — same
#: shape, same length, same port — turns the same angle at ``1/sqrt(2)`` of the amplitude
#: one rung up. This is the only form of the ladder with nothing else in it: the envelope
#: ratio and the duration ratio both cancel when the two pulses are identical, which is
#: what `ef_ladder` exists to arrange. See :data:`EF_ENVELOPE_AREA` for the correction
#: `rabi_12`'s own guard needs, and which this measurement does not.
LADDER_RATIO = math.sqrt(2.0)

#: Linewidths of resonator to sweep when looking for the three-state readout point.
#:
#: Wider than the 0.6 `readout_operating_point` uses, because the ladder it has to resolve
#: is wider: two states sit ``2*chi`` apart and the point that tells them apart is a
#: fraction of a linewidth off resonance, while three sit across ``4*chi`` and the point
#: that separates all three can be a whole flank out. Borrowing the two-state coefficient
#: broke this node outright — see :meth:`ThreeStateOperatingPoint._grid`.
#:
#: 1.8, which is where the 6 MHz constant this replaces came from: it reproduces it on the
#: simulated chip's 3.31 MHz resonator to 0.7%. The constant only looked right because that
#: was the chip it was measured on.
SPAN_IN_LINEWIDTHS = 1.8


#: How many sigma the scheduler's DRAG envelope spans *each side* of centre.
#:
#: The whole point of naming it. ``nr_sigma`` is the scheduler's own parameter and its
#: docstring says "after how many sigma the Gaussian is cut off" — which is per side, so a
#: pulse of length ``T`` has ``sigma = T / (2 * nr_sigma)``, not ``T / nr_sigma``. Reading
#: it the other way is what put :data:`EF_ENVELOPE_AREA` out by exactly two, and a factor
#: of two is the one error this module is least able to see, because it is also the spacing
#: of the cosine roots `fit_rabi` chooses between.
#:
#: A library convention rather than a chip's, and the executors do not override it — they
#: construct ``DRAGPulse`` without it, so this is that default. Written here because the
#: tuner layer has no scheduler to ask, and asserted against the emitted pulse in
#: `test_ef_envelope_area_matches_the_real_waveform` so an upstream change fails loudly
#: instead of recentring every ef bound.
RXY_NR_SIGMA = 4.0

#: Area of `rxy`'s envelope against the ef pulse's, at equal amplitude.
#:
#: They are not the same shape, which the first version of the ladder bound missed. `rxy`
#: compiles through quantify's ``rxy_drag_pulse`` to a Gaussian cut at
#: :data:`RXY_NR_SIGMA`; `add_ef_pulse` emits a `SquarePulse` of area ``A*T``. Rotation
#: follows area, so the same *nominal* amplitude turns a larger angle on the ef transition,
#: and comparing the two amplitudes without the correction centres the bound too high.
#:
#: Derived rather than integrated, so it is worth saying what pins it: `test_ef_envelope_
#: area_matches_the_real_waveform` integrates quantify's actual ``drag`` output and asserts
#: this number. It exists because the hand-derived version was wrong by two for four days,
#: refusing a chip whose `ef_ladder` then measured the ratio at 1.49 against sqrt(2) —
#: 5.6%, which is the anharmonic correction and not a factor of two.
EF_ENVELOPE_AREA = math.sqrt(2.0 * math.pi) / (2.0 * RXY_NR_SIGMA)

        # Two attempts. Sharing `readout_operating_point`'s 0.6 of a linewidth broke it
        # outright: `ramsey_12`'s T2* came back at 250 us against a 0-1 coherence of 20 us,
        # a fit extrapolating through a fringe with no decay left in it. The coefficient
        # does not transfer because the ladder is wider — two states sit 2chi apart and the
        # point that tells them apart is within a fraction of a linewidth of resonance,
        # while three sit across 4chi and the point that separates all three can be
        # further out.

        # Then 1.8 linewidths, which reproduces this constant on the simulated chip almost
        # exactly (1.8 x 3.31 MHz = 5.96 MHz). That left `ramsey_12`'s fringe at 3.0x its
        # scatter against the 3x its guard allows — passing by nothing, on a quantity that
        # now varies with a measurement.
        #
        # Derived after all, from the coefficient the note above had already found. 1.8
        # linewidths reproduces the old 6 MHz constant on the simulated chip to 0.7%
        # (1.8 x 3.31 MHz = 5.96 MHz), and a constant is what broke this on the second
        # chip the graph met — the same way it broke `readout_operating_point`, whose
        # 2 MHz was 5.4 linewidths there and put the outer setpoints off resonance.
        #
        # This resonator is 327 kHz wide, so 6 MHz is *eighteen* linewidths: four of the
        # five points would sit where nothing comes back. Hand-narrowing it to 200 kHz
        # goes wrong the other way — that is 0.61 linewidths, which is the two-state
        # coefficient this node's docstring records as breaking it outright, and it never
        # reaches the flank where |1> and |2> separate. Those two sit only 11 kHz apart in
        # resonator shift (-102 against -91 kHz) against a 327 kHz linewidth, so the point

    The pi/2 pre-rotation is not decoration. Without it the response goes as
    ``cos(n(pi+delta))``, identical at integer ``n`` for an over- and an
    under-rotation; the pre-rotation makes it a sine and the sign measurable.

    **Reads at the ordinary 0-1 point, by mapping back.** It used to read at the
    three-state one and depend on `three_state_operating_point`, on the grounds that its
    reference states are ``|1>`` and ``|2>`` and those sit almost on top of each other at
    a 0-1 readout. True, and `rabi_12` solves it: a second 0-1 pi after the ef pulses
    returns ``|1>`` to ``|0>`` and leaves ``|2>`` where it is, so the ef rotation appears
    in the ``|0>`` population — the one quantity a 0-1 readout is already good at. The
    same trick, one node along.

    That dependency was also a deadlock. `three_state_operating_point` needs a correct ef
    pi to populate ``|2>`` at all, and this is the node that makes the ef pi correct; on a
    chip whose three-state clouds never separated, this and the three nodes behind it never
    ran once in six attempts. tergite-autocalibration's equivalent, `n_rabi_12_oscillations`,
    reads at ``qubit_state = 1`` and needs no three-state readout either.

    Amplification is also what settles which oscillation `rabi_12` found. A per-pulse error
    grows linearly with repetitions while noise does not, so an ef amplitude that is out by
    the factor of two that chip alternates between is unmistakable by the seventh pulse,
    where a single-pulse sweep confuses the two.

    A characterisation, not a calibration: it writes nothing. It exists because
    `rabi_12`'s ladder guard has to *predict* the 1-2 pi amplitude from the 0-1 one, and
    that prediction carries two corrections which are properties of the pulses rather than
    of the chip — `rxy` compiles to a Gaussian of area ``0.627*A*T`` where `add_ef_pulse`
    emits a square of area ``A*T``, and the two may be configured to different lengths. On
    the August 2026 B chip the prediction came out 3.7x above the measurement and no
    correction accounted for it.

    So this removes the corrections rather than refining them. It sweeps the *same* pulse
    `rabi_12` sweeps — same envelope, same duration, same port, over the same amplitudes —
    on the ``.01`` clock instead of the ``.12``. Both factors cancel identically, and what
    is left is the ladder alone: the ratio of the two pi amplitudes must be
    :data:`LADDER_RATIO`, and it is a statement about the transmon that no pulse convention
    can move.

    Which makes the answer diagnostic either way. Near ``sqrt(2)`` and the ladder holds, so
    `rabi_12`'s amplitude is right and the 3.7x lives in the corrections. Far from it and
    the two clocks are not being driven alike — the same nominal amplitude reaching the port
    differently at 68 MHz from the LO than at 319 MHz — which is a property of the output
    chain and not of the chip, and nothing in this graph can calibrate it away.
