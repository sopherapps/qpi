#: The most Cliffords one RB *schedule* may hold, across every depth and circuit in it.
#:
#: A chunk size, not a ceiling. RB's cost is per gate, so averaging harder eventually
#: exceeds any program a sequencer will take — and the answer RFC 0007 §5 gives for a sweep
#: too large for one schedule is to chunk it across acquisitions rather than refuse it.
#: `RandomizedBenchmarking.acquire` splits on this number and combines the results, so the
#: circuit count an operator asks for is honoured however large it is.
#:
#: **Measured, at the second attempt.** It was 2500, derived from a Clifford averaging 1.875
#: pulses at a couple of instructions each — near four — and its docstring said plainly that
#: the figure had never been checked against a real program and should be measured if it ever
#: bound. It bound, and was still twice too high: on the August 2026 B chip a sweep of 2413
#: Cliffords compiled to 1,133,426 bytes, which the driver's own error reported in its SCPI
#: block header (``PROGram  #71133426``). At roughly 45 characters a line that is some 25,000
#: instructions — **10.4 per Clifford**, not four — and the 12288 a sequencer accepts affords
#: about 1180. 1000 leaves the 15% headroom `MAX_SWEEP_POINTS` leaves for the same reason.
#:
#: Circuits can be split across schedules; a single *sequence* cannot. So this also bounds
#: the deepest sequence escalation will reach, and that one is a real ceiling — see
#: `RandomizedBenchmarking.build_schedule`.
