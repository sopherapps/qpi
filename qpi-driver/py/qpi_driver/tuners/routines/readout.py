"""Calibrating the readout chain itself (RFC 0005 §7).

The routines in `spectroscopy` find the resonator and how hard to drive it. This one
answers the question that comes after: given the two clouds the readout produces,
which line separates them?

That line is `measure.acq_rotation` and `measure.acq_threshold`, and until now
nothing produced them. They default to zero, a working chip's device config does not
carry them at all, and **every** ``meas_level=2`` shot is assigned by comparing a
rotated real part against them — so the default job path was discriminating with an
uncalibrated rule. Zero is correct only for a readout chain that happens to place the
clouds either side of the imaginary axis, which nothing arranges.

This needs the state-resolved readout the simulator gained alongside it: with two
clouds placed by hand there was no rotation to find, because the placement *was* the
answer.
