    means comparing how clearly each power shows the line, and there is no line to
    look at until this routine has found it. Nor can it be calibrated after, since
    this routine's own answer depends on it. So it is one measurement of two
    quantities, the way `resonator_punchout` is.

    ``spec.amplitude`` only exists on a `CalibratedTransmon`. Against a config that
    keeps `BasicTransmonElement` the sweep still runs and still picks its best row —

    #:
    #: Geometric, and that is the whole design: the response is power-law with an unknown
    #: scale, and `fit_spectroscopy_power` keeps the *narrowest* credible line of the set, so
    #: a wide bracket costs acquisitions rather than accuracy. A linear ladder would spend
    #: its rungs in one decade and miss whichever one the chip is in.
    #:
    #: **Raising the ceiling was tried in August 2026 and reverted.** Two chips disagree, and
    #: both are evidence. A B-chip transition reached only 3.33x over its own scatter at 0.08
    #: against the 5x `require_resolved_line` clears, so this ladder cannot see every real
    #: line. But a ladder reaching 0.3 put the simulated chip's calibrated f01 1.76 MHz out,
    #: against a 1 MHz tolerance — measured against the same rung *count* at these powers,
    #: which passes, so it is the power and not the changed noise draw.
    #:
    #: So the right ceiling is a property of the chip and its drive chain, which is what
    #: ``drive_amps`` is for. A chip that needs more than this says so by refusing, and the
    #: refusal names the axis; guessing higher here trades a chip that cannot be seen for
    #: every chip being measured slightly worse.

    #: Multiples of a remembered power to bracket on a recalibration. Three rather
    #: than five, because this sweep costs one acquisition per power *per frequency*:
    #: a bring-up pays that to find the right end of a wide range, and a
    #: recalibration should not pay it again to confirm what it already knows.
    RECALIBRATION_FACTORS = (0.5, 1.0, 2.0)

    #: How far the widening pass looks, and how finely.
    #:
    #: Not as wide as it could usefully be, and the ceiling is hardware. An RF module
    #: reaches +/-500 MHz either side of its LO — quantify's ``NCO_FREQ_LIMIT_STEPS`` over
    #: ``NCO_FREQ_STEPS_PER_HZ`` — so a 1 GHz search is addressable only when the LO sits
    #: at the search centre, and asking past that does not compile. 600 MHz leaves 200 MHz
    #: of slack for an LO placed off-centre, which is the usual case.
    #:
    #: So the operator still has to widen this on a chip further out than 300 MHz, and the
    #: refusal below says so. What the default buys is that being a few hundred MHz wrong
    #: — a design value, a different flux bias — no longer needs anyone to notice.
    #:
    #: 2 MHz steps sit inside the width a saturating drive broadens the line to, so a real
    #: line lands in some bin, and 301 acquisitions is well clear of what a sequencer
    #: assembles.
    SEARCH_SPAN = 600e6
    SEARCH_POINTS = 301

    #: The widening pass drives at one power, and locating a line does not need powers
    #: compared — five of them across 301 frequencies is 1505 acquisitions, past what a
    #: sequencer assembles. Which power is *derived*: the strongest this routine would try
    #: anyway, so `_drive_amplitudes` answers it.
    #:
    #: It was a constant equal to the old `DEFAULT_AMPLITUDES` ceiling, which made the
    #: "strongest anyway" claim true only until either changed. An operator raising
    #: ``drive_amps`` to 0.3 left the search probing 3.75x weaker than the pass it exists to
    #: feed — backwards, since the search is the one that has to *see* a line at all, and
    #: the confirm pass is where a gentle power belongs.

    #: How wide the sweep that *confirms* a searched-out line should be, as a multiple of
    #: the width the search measured, and over how many points.
    #:
    #: The operator's ``span`` cannot be reused for it. A span says *where the line might
    #: be*, and once the search has located it that statement is spent — worse, a config
    #: whose span was wide precisely because it did not know where to look then confirms
    #: on a grid far too coarse to resolve anything. The loop fixture is the case: it
    #: sweeps 600 MHz over 61 points to find a qubit 214 MHz from its config, and
    #: re-centring that same grid steps 10 MHz across a line about as wide.
    #:
    #: Nor is a fixed window right, because the line's width is set by the drive
    #: amplitude the confirming sweep is itself choosing. Measured on the simulated chip
    #: against a line about 140 MHz wide at the strongest drive, by window:
    #:
    #:     20 MHz   refused, nothing clears the floor
    #:     40 MHz   reach 5.0, exactly at the floor, f01 1.62 MHz out
    #:    100 MHz   reach 60.7, f01 0.88 MHz out
    #:    200 MHz   reach 83.5, f01 1.17 MHz out
    #:    400 MHz   reach 31.5, f01 0.97 MHz out
    #:
    #: So a little over one width is the sweet spot: enough baseline either side to
    #: measure the line against, without diluting it across a window it does not fill.
    #: 1.5 is that, and it is derived rather than guessed — an earlier four-search-steps
