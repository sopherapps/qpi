"""Two coupled transmons, for the CZ that one transmon cannot have (RFC 0004 §7).

:class:`~qpi_driver.simulation.transmon.TransmonSimulator` models one qubit. Two
of them side by side are still two independent density matrices, so entanglement
is not merely absent — it is unrepresentable, and a Bell state could not come out
wrong because it could not come out at all. This module holds the two in one
register (3 levels each, so a 9-dimensional Hilbert space and an 81-dimensional
Liouvillian) and couples them, which is the smallest change that makes a CZ a
thing the simulator can get wrong.

**Two CZs, because the hardware has two.** Both work by exchanging ``|11⟩`` with
``|02⟩`` and letting the round trip leave a phase on ``|11⟩`` alone, and neither
writes a chevron or a conditional phase down — both fall out of integrating the
Hamiltonian. What differs is how the exchange is switched on:

- **DC flux on a qubit's own port**, which a stock `CompositeSquareEdge` emits.
  ``|11⟩`` and ``|02⟩`` are degenerate when the control sits one anharmonicity
  below the target, and a flux pulse walks the control through that crossing.
- **A parametric drive on a coupler**, which `FluxTunableCoupler` emits. The
  coupler between the two qubits is modulated at microwave frequency and a
  sideband bridges the gap, so the qubits need not be near each other — and the
  drive *frequency*, not the amplitude, is what decides whether the gate happens
  at all.

**Where this tier is weaker than the one-qubit one, and it matters.** The
one-qubit simulator derives everything from a Cooper-pair-box Hamiltonian whose
parameters are physical constants: no number in it was chosen to make a test
pass. Several numbers here *were* chosen — :data:`G_MHZ`,
:data:`FLUX_CURVATURE_GHZ`, :data:`SIDEBAND_GAP_GHZ`,
:data:`PARAMETRIC_RATE_MHZ`, :data:`STARK_SHIFT_MHZ` and
:data:`STARK_ASYMMETRY` — because they describe a coupler and a flux line this
project has no device to measure. Each one says in its own comment how it was
picked, and :data:`PARAMETRIC_RATE_MHZ` at least comes from calibrated operating
points measured on a real chip rather than from nothing.

Given them the dynamics are real, and a routine still has to find a crossing it
was not told the location of. But the claim in RFC 0004 §7 that "nothing is
generated from a fitting model" is a claim about the one-qubit tier, and it is
weaker here. Read a two-qubit result as "the routine recovers the operating
point of a plausible coupler", not "of a real one".

from qpi_driver.simulation.transmon import NS, TransmonSimulator

#: Exchange coupling ``g/2π`` in MHz. Chosen, not measured: it sets the size of
#: the avoided crossing, and with it the duration of a CZ. The ``|11⟩``–``|02⟩``
#: matrix element is ``√2 g``, so a full round trip takes ``π/(√2·2π·g)`` — about
#: 110 ns here, which puts the CZ inside the duration window `cz_chevron` sweeps
#: by default rather than off its edge. A real fixed-coupling pair is a few MHz
#: to a few tens; this is at the low end of normal.
G_MHZ = 3.2

#: Always-on ``ZZ`` coupling between the pair, in MHz. Zero, so nothing changes unless a
#: test asks for it.
#:
#: What it is for, and what it is not. A driven qubit shifts its neighbour's frequency by
#: this much, so a pulse calibrated in isolation is slightly wrong when the neighbour is
#: driven too — which is the crosstalk a fused group is exposed to and a sequential walk is
#: not. Switching it on is how `parallel_penalty` can be shown to *detect* something
#: (RFC 0009 D10).
#:
#: It cannot license a grouping. The number would be one this project chose, so a test
#: asserting that some `qubit_spacing` is safe would be asserting the constant rather than
#: the chip — and `MAX_ENTANGLED` caps a joint register at three qubits, so a chip-scale
#: group is out of reach in principle. The detector is testable here; the radius is settled
#: on hardware, by §5.6's measurement.
ZZ_MHZ = 0.0

#: Flux-pulse amplitude to control-qubit detuning, in GHz per squared unit of
#: amplitude. Also chosen. Quadratic because a transmon sits at a flux sweet spot
#: where the first derivative of frequency with flux vanishes, so the leading
#: behaviour is second order. The scale puts the ``|11⟩``–``|02⟩`` resonance near
#: the middle of the amplitude window `cz_chevron` sweeps — but deliberately
#: *between* two of its default setpoints (0.376, where the grid has 0.35 and
#: 0.40). A resonance sitting exactly on a grid point would let a routine find it
#: by luck, and the coarseness of that default grid is a real finding (§7).
FLUX_CURVATURE_GHZ = 2.0

#: The transition a parametric coupler drive bridges, in GHz.
#:
#: This is the *other* CZ, and the one `FluxTunableCoupler` builds. Rather than
#: pushing a qubit onto the ``|11⟩``–``|02⟩`` crossing with DC flux, the coupler
#: between the two is modulated at microwave frequency and a sideband of that
#: modulation bridges the gap. The DC bias only parks the coupler; the gate is
#: the tone on top.
#:
#: Two consequences make it a different gate to model rather than a rearrangement
#: of the same one: it works with qubits nowhere near each other, because the
#: modulation supplies the detuning instead of the qubit placement having to; and
#: the resonance condition is on the drive *frequency*, so amplitude sets how fast
#: the exchange runs while frequency sets whether it runs at all.
#:
#: The value matches the ``clock_freqs.cz`` every edge carries in the configuration
#: of a working chip. Which transition of the coupler-qubit spectrum it actually is
#: depends on the coupler's own frequency, which this simulator does not model — so
#: this is a chosen constant, and a routine finding a resonance here has found the
#: one it was configured to look for.
SIDEBAND_GAP_GHZ = 3.9

#: Exchange rate in MHz per unit of coupler drive amplitude — linear, as the
#: leading order of a parametric drive is.
#:
#: Not invented: four calibrated edges off a real chip imply 4.29, 1.91, 4.91 and
#: 6.41 MHz per unit from their own (amplitude, duration) pairs, reading each duration
#: as one full ``|11⟩ → |02⟩ → |11⟩`` round trip. This is their mean, so a device
#: config taken off the bench lands near a real CZ here rather than nowhere. The
#: spread across those four is itself the point that couplers differ.
PARAMETRIC_RATE_MHZ = 4.4

#: AC Stark shift per qubit, in MHz per unit of drive amplitude squared. A
#: modulated coupler pushes both qubits around while it drives the exchange, and
#: the phase that leaves is single-qubit rather than conditional — so no amount
#: of tuning amplitude or duration removes it. It is exactly what the edge's
#: ``<qubit>_phase_correction`` parameters exist to cancel, and with them at zero
#: a perfectly good CZ still produces the wrong Bell state.
STARK_SHIFT_MHZ = 9.0

#: How much harder the drive pushes the child than the parent. Deliberately not
#: 1: with a symmetric shift one correction would fix both qubits, and a test
#: could not tell a correction written to the wrong qubit from a right one.
STARK_ASYMMETRY = 1.37


#: The coupler's own frequency at zero bias, in GHz — its flux sweet spot.
#:
#: Above both qubits, which is where a tunable coupler is normally parked: pushing it
#: *down* through them with current is what makes the two anticrossings findable, and
#: what makes the effective coupling tunable through zero on the way.
COUPLER_FREQUENCY_GHZ = 6.5

#: How far the coupler's frequency falls per squared ampere of parking current, in
#: GHz. Quadratic for the reason :data:`FLUX_CURVATURE_GHZ` gives — a sweet spot has
#: no first derivative — and scaled so the two anticrossings land within the few
#: milliamps an S4g can deliver, which is the range `bias.parking_current` is
#: validated over.
COUPLER_CURVATURE_GHZ_PER_A2 = 1.3e5

#: Coupler-to-qubit coupling ``g/2pi`` in MHz. Larger than the direct qubit-qubit
#: :data:`G_MHZ`, as it must be: the coupler exists to *mediate*, so its legs are the
#: strong couplings and the residual direct term is the weak one.

class TunableCoupler:
    """A coupler as a mode of its own, with a frequency a DC current moves.

    Until this existed the coupler was only ever a *drive*: `SIDEBAND_GAP_GHZ` was a
    chosen constant and said so, and `bias.parking_current` was carried, validated,
    applied — and never measured, because nothing in the simulator responded to it.

    What it adds is the one observable that makes the bias measurable: each qubit is
    pushed by the coupler it is coupled to, by ``g^2 / (f_qubit - f_coupler)``, and
    that push runs away as the coupler is tuned onto the qubit. Sweeping the current
    and watching a qubit's frequency move is `coupler_anticrossing`, and the two
    crossings it finds are what place the parking point.

    **The push is measured from zero bias, not from nothing.** A qubit sitting near a
    coupler is always pushed; what a bias *changes* is how much. Defining the shift as
    the difference from the zero-current push keeps the simulator's ``f01`` meaning
    what it has always meant — the qubit's frequency as configured — so a chip whose
    couplers are unparked behaves exactly as it did before this existed.
